Hello, Iâ€™m @otokotoba! Strictly speaking, "Otokotoba" is a personal music project run by Nanashi, a royalty free BGM and Vocaloid producer.

I've been learning web technologies and would like to collaborate on softwear related to music in the future because I've been learning it too.

If you are interested in my project, please check out the links below.
