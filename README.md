Wellcome to "Otokotoba", which is a personal music project run by Nanashi, a musician and engineer.
You can call me Otokotoba or Nanashi. Either is fine.

I've been learning web technologies and would like to collaborate on software related to music in the future because I've been learning it too.

If you are interested in my music project, please check out the links below.
